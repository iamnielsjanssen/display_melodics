A quick and dirty viewer for the ICs generated by FSL Melodic

This program lets you quickly classify 'bad' and 'good' components and saves them in separate files.

These classifications can be further used for denoising using fsl_regfilt or fsl fix. 

Written for Python 2.7, using Tkinter and PIL. 

Instructions:

First, download 'display_melodics.py' into your python scripts folder (e.g., /home/user/mypythonscripts)
Next, run melodic on your functional data and obtain a folder with the images of the ICs (e.g., filtered_func_data.ica/reports/)
Next, go to the folder with the images (e.g., filtered_func_data.ica/reports) and run the script using python
(e.g., 'python /home/user/mypythonscripts/display_melodics.py')

When looking at the ICs, press 'r' to move the component to the 'to_remove' list, and 'k' to move it to the 'to_keep' list. 
Press 'q' to quit.

When you have seen all ICs, the program writes two text files: 'to_remove.txt' and 'to_keep.txt' to the current folder.
